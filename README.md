# Kage.Quest Main Javascript
This JavaScript code was entirely hand-written by myself, and functions as the backbone to my portfolio site, [Kage.Quest](https://www.kage.quest/).

It handles section transitions, custom CMS carousel functionality, logo effects + easter eggs, URL parameter logic, and most button functionality.
